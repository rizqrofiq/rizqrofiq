Hi there! I'm interested in web development and constantly expanding my skills. Currently, I'm delving into the world of Golang, Javascript, and Python.

As a person who loves to try new things and has a passion for computers and technology, I find myself drawn to backend development. I enjoy the challenge of working with databases and creating seamless communication between the frontend and backend.

Through my learning journey, I hope to contribute to the creation of dynamic and efficient web applications that provide a seamless user experience.
